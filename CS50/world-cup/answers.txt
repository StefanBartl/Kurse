Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

That here is any relation between putting another 0 to to N and the time....

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10000, because after it there is not much change at the top and a the middle and bottom there are significantly better %....
