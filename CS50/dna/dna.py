# Implement a program that identifies a person based on their DNA

import csv
import sys

# Specification

# The program should require as its first command-line argument the name of a CSV file
# containing the STR counts for a list of individuals and should require as its
# second command-line argument the name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify.

# If your program is executed with the incorrect number of command-line arguments,
# your program should print an error message of your choice (with print).
# If the correct number of arguments are provided, you may assume that the
# first argument is indeed the filename of a valid CSV file and that the second
# argument is the filename of a valid text file.

# Your program should open the CSV file and read its contents into memory.

# You may assume that the first row of the CSV file will be the column names.
# The first column will be the word name and the remaining columns will be the STR sequences themselves.

# Your program should open the DNA sequence and read its contents into memory.

# For each of the STRs (from the first line of the CSV file), your program should compute
# the longest run of consecutive repeats of the STR in the DNA sequence to identify.
# Notice that weâ€™ve defined a helper function for you, longest_match, which will do just that!

# If the STR counts match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file,
# your program should print out the name of the matching individual.

# You may assume that the STR counts will not match more than one individual.

# If the STR counts do not match exactly with any of the individuals in the CSV file, your program should print No match.
