/*
Create two files: export.js and main.js and do the following:

Export the function createUser as default from export.js. Import it into main.js 
but with the alias userCreator and call it.
Export the functions printName and printAge. Import these with the aliases 
printFirstName and printDOB from export.js into main.js and call them.
Hint: Use the stub function implementation () => null to implement all functions.
 This exercise is about import/export statements and not the function implementations.
