Web Assembly (wasm) is a powerful low-level language that is meant to be a compile target for high-level languages. It is designed to be portable and ran in many different environments. It is designed to _compliment_ JavaScript, not replace it.


Web Assembly runs in its own environment at near native speed, can be cached, and runs much faster than JavaScript can be parsed.

#### File types
Web Assembly has two file types:
- `.wasm` is the actual assembly code in binary format
- `.wat` is the human readable textual representation of the code
