It should give an overview of my skills in the areas of CSS/Sass, JavaScript/TypeScript (incl. frameworks like NextJS) & cyber security, offer a contact and information opportunity for interested parties and also serve as a learning curve archive for myself. Please note that I do not expand older projects with newly learned skills, but - if useful - make a new project out of it. At the moment I'm working intensively on Rust, corresponding projects will follow. I hope you enjoy my work!",

In the CSS area, I would like to recommend all web content by Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) whose videos and courses have also helped me a lot.

After completing an apprenticeship and the first 6 years of work, I switched to union representation in order to realize my socio-political interests and to work with people to build a better future that can only be fought for and worked out together. As a trade unionist, I have many years of project management experience and, in numerous further training courses, skills in many different areas, such as rhetoric/moderation, group dynamics, pedagogy, event management, budget responsibility, economics, politics and much more. can collect and build up a corresponding network. Above all, networked and interdisciplinary activities are a lot of fun for me. Since 2020 I fill most of my free time with courses and further education in the fields of web development and computer science, usually in self-study. Since then I've been gripped by 'developer' fever and look forward to challenging problems and their creative solutions. I am currently looking for a permanent position in the field of web development/IT.Security and am looking forward to the relevant contacts!",
